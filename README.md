I'm Dave.  
I'm a hobbiest working in robotics and mobile applications, trying to understand Web, LAN and Serial communications.
I've primarily worked in C++, Cura and Arduino in the past.

Also, in my day job I am an industrial mechanic with an interest in electronics, storytelling, woodworking, metalworking and robotics.
